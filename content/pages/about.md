Hi, I'm {{ siteConfig.author.name }} (he/they). This website is the home of my software development work under **Gray Seven Software LLC**.

I'm currently working on a powerlifting handler app, Handly. 

I also [powerlift competitively](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/matthewgray1), enjoy vegetable gardening, and am a fan of the esport Rocket League. If you have any questions feel free to contact me via my email address: m@(this domain name).
